This folder contains a working version of the Python program to run test vectors on the R232. 
For the program to run successfully git bash should be installed. 

At the moment there is only one way to run the program

- From a bash terminal make sure the path is directed to <Python-Scripts-Rev-B> and run 'python __main__.py' 

For the most part the gui should guide you through use, but general usage is as follows:
A connection must be made with the 'Check Connection' button before anything can be done. If no connection is made,
or if the connection is interrupted at any time, the program must be restarted to work.
Once a connection is made a file is selected with the 'Select File' button and then vectors can be tested
with the 'Test Vectors' button. The 'Clear Window' button erases text in the window and the 'Quit' button terminates the program.
